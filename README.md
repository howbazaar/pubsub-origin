# pubsub
    import "github.com/juju/pubsub"

Package pubsub provides publish and subscribe functionality.







## type Completer
``` go
type Completer interface {
    // Complete returns a channel that is closed when all the subscribers
    // have been notified of the event.
    Complete() <-chan struct{}
}
```
Completer provides a way for the caller of publish to know when all of the
subscribers have finished being notified.











## type Hub
``` go
type Hub interface {

    // Publish will notifiy all the subscribers that are interested by calling
    // their handler function.
    Publish(topic string, data interface{}) (Completer, error)

    // Subscribe takes a topic regular expression, and a handler function.
    // If the topicRegex is not a valid regular expression, and error is returned.
    Subscribe(topicRegex string, handler interface{}) (Unsubscriber, error)
}
```
Hub represents an in-process delivery mechanism. The hub maintains a
list of topic subscribers.









### func NewSimpleHub
``` go
func NewSimpleHub() Hub
```
NewSimpleHub returns a new Hub instance.

A simple hub does not touch the data that is passed through to Publish.
This data is passed through to each Subscriber. Note that all subscribers
are notified in parallel, and that no modification should be done to the
data or data races will occur.


### func NewStructuredHub
``` go
func NewStructuredHub(annotations map[string]interface{}) Hub
```
NewStructuredHub returns a new Hub instance.

A structured hub serializes the data through an intermediate format.
In this case, JSON.
The annotations are added to each message that is published IFF the values
are not already set.




## type Unsubscriber
``` go
type Unsubscriber interface {
    Unsubscribe()
}
```
Unsubscriber provides a simple way to Unsubscribe.
